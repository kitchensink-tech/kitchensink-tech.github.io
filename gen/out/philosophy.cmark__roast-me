Wow, where do I even start? This article is like a trainwreck that you can't look away from. Let me try to break it down and offer some (honest, but sarcastic) feedback.

First of all, the title "The Kitchen Sink philosophy" should be changed to something more accurate, like "A Philosophical Ramble About Doing Nothing". The introduction is a great example of this style - it's like you're trying to convince us that laziness is a virtue and that we should all just throw our work in a sink and hope for the best.

Now, let's talk about the three tenets of the Kitchen Sink philosophy:

1. Frivolity: Ah, because the world is tough enough without expecting ourselves to be perfect. I'm glad you're embracing the "take it easy" approach, but maybe that's not exactly what we need in a software project.
2. Defeatism: I love how you're using defeatist language to describe your section-based format. It's like you're saying, "Oh well, templates are overrated, let's just throw this together and hope it works." That's exactly the kind of attitude that gets projects stuck in a rut.
3. Versatility: Because flexibility is what matters most - even if it means bending the system a bit. I'm not sure what kind of engineering experience you have, but sometimes "bending" can just be called "bugging."

Some highlights from the features section:

* The section-based format is like a defeatist echo because... well, it's hard to explain.
* Wordcount is wonky, but that's okay because we shouldn't care about accuracy.
* Open-graph and Twitter meta tags are awesome ways to propagate information around - even if they seem unsatisfying.
* Markdown and Commonmark: they do the job, and you can write, which is more than I can say for most modern web tools.

In conclusion, this article is a masterclass in how not to write a philosophical treatise. But hey, at least it's entertaining! If you're looking for actual advice on software development, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.
