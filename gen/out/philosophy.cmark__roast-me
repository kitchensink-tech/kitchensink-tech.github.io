*sigh* Oh boy, where do I even start?

First off, let's talk about how this blog post is literally just a dumping ground for your thoughts. Like, I get it, you're trying to explain the Kitchen Sink philosophy and its three tenets, but all I see are ramblings about frivolity, defeatism, and awe, with no actual structure or coherence.

Now, let's dive into some specific issues:

* Your writing style is like a middle schooler's diary entry - it's personal, emotional, and cringeworthy. Like, seriously, who uses the phrase "I grew out of experience"? Get over yourself.
* The formatting is straight out of a 2004-era blog template. It looks like you just threw all your paragraphs together without caring about readability or aesthetics.
* Your ideas are interesting, I guess. But they're presented in such a sloppy and disorganized way that it's hard to follow along. Like, what's the point of "be kind onto yourself"? Is this some sort of existential crisis? 
* The section on features is literally just a list of stuff that you've added to your website over time, without any real analysis or thought process behind them. It feels like you're just checking off boxes because you feel obligated, not because you've actually put any thought into it.
* And don't even get me started on the tone. You seem to be trying to come across as some sort of benevolent dictator, guiding people towards the "true" path of the Kitchen Sink philosophy. Newsflash: nobody likes a know-it-all.

Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this blog post is a mess. But hey, at least you're out there trying to share your thoughts with the world, even if they're a bit...unrefined.
