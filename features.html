<ul>
<li>i. a set of <em>libraries</em> (at the time of writing, everything is packed in a single library: it’s a kitchen sink afterall)
</li>
<li>ii. a default <em>executable</em> which uses defaults from the library
</li>
</ul>
<p>The library allows you to write a program to author websites from content
thrown into a folder. The name Kitchen-Sink comes from the fact that Kitchen
Sink is meant to work with a single folder having no particular organization
besides filenames.</p>
<p>The executable imports the library to demonstrates and implements a
blog-generator generating HTML having a default layout (for this very website
for instance).  Thus, as a Kitchen-Sink user you could either run the
executable directly (if you want a website that looks like this one for
instance) or write your own executable from the library.</p>
<p>When we refer to <em>the Kitchen Sink engine</em> or <em>the blog engine</em>, we thus refer
to features available from the libary. As of this writing, however, I have yet
to finish modularizing all these features. However, the following sections
provide a listing of features with a good overall structure of what could go in
which libraries.</p>
</section><section class="main-section"><h2 id="command-line-single-run-mode">command-line single-run mode</h2>
<p>The default executable can run as a one-off generator command.  The intended
use-case if for generating websites as part of automated pipelines. There is
nothing really exciting about the command-line single-run mode.</p>
<p>Example usage with the default executable:</p>
<p><code>kitchen-sink produce --srcDir website-src --outDir website-www</code></p>

<p>These logs indicate that files where sourced in the <code>website-src</code> directory,
then computation occured, and finally files where output in the <code>website-www</code>
directory. You can navigate with a browser in this directory. However when
authoring articles it is pretty annoying to do manual refreshes. Instead,
Kitchen-Sink incorporates a server able to directly serve the same content as
it generates.</p>
</section><section class="main-section"><h2 id="server-mode">server-mode</h2>
<p>One key reason for having written Kitchen-Sink is to explore things that makes
my life easy. Among these: live</p>
<h3 id="live-serving">live-serving</h3>
<p>Rather than generating all the website once, Kitchen-Sink can run an HTTP
server that will directly return the results of the output targets <em>on the
fly</em>.  That is, each time a web-browser navigates, the latest value for a given
route is shown to the browser. This is not especially useful but can come handy.</p>
<p>Example usage with the default executable:</p>
<p><code>$ kitchen-sink serve --srcDir website-src --outDir website-www --servMode SERVE --port 7654</code></p>

<h3 id="auto-reload">auto-reload</h3>
<p>The executable server has a special API route with a mechanism to wait for changes
of source files on the file-system.  We also bundle a <a href="/js/autoreload.js">small JavaScript</a> that
subscribes to changes and reload the page on a change. This JavaScript gets
injected in the layout only in dev-server mode. This setup allows to auto-reload on change.</p>

  <source src="/videos/auto-reload-002-liveedit.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>To use the dev-server mode, use <code>--servMode DEV</code>. That is, the full-command to run with the default executable is:</p>
<p><code>kitchen-sink serve --srcDir website-src --outDir website-www --servMode DEV --port 7654</code></p>
<h3 id="one-time-commands">one-time commands</h3>
<p>In addition to the above auto-reload script. The default executable’s layout insert some buttons to get one-click.</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>produce</code> button will regenerate the whole HTML output
</li>
<li>the <code>publish</code> button will call the <code>publishScript</code> command in the <a href="/kitchen-sink-dot-json.html">kitchen-sink.json file</a> . As a data-point, I use <a href="/gen/out/features.cmark__cat-publish-script">this publish-script</a> for this documentation site.

<h3 id="its-just-a-webserver-library">it’s just a webserver library</h3>
<p>I’ve not really explored this avenue, but it should be possible to incorporate
the webserver logic in most Haskell web-applications (e.g., your
web-application could run an API and Kitchen-Sink could run some documentation
pages aside).</p>
<h3 id="server-metrics">server metrics</h3>
<p>Why not? to build the webserver-library I’ve used some set of <a href="https://github.com/lucasdicioccio/prodapi">curated and
bundled libraries named ProdAPI</a>.
Which means the server inherits a number of features; among which a number of
<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus counters</a>. An example set of metrics is
available on <a href="/gen/out/features.cmark__gen-local-server-metrics.txt">this
extract</a>. Thus, rather
than bragging how much Kitchen-Sink is fast, you get to see for yourself
directly (e.g., with the <code>blog_fullbuild_time</code> counters in the Prometheus
summary). Other usages would be to track how fast you add content to articles
by collecting and storing the counters. For instance, this is a timeseries of
me editing this paragraph in live thanks to <a href="https://lucasdicioccio.github.io/prometheus-monitor.html">a Firefox extension I
built</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/features-001-targetsizes-timeseries.png" alt="a timeseries graph showing the blog_targets_sizes prometheus counter" /></p>
</section><section class="main-section"><h2 id="article-authoring">article authoring</h2>
<p>Writing articles is the most important thing of a static-site generator.  The
<a href="/philosophy.html">Kitchen-Sink Philosophy</a> here is to throw everything in one
file. The key, and probably somewhat unique aspect of Kitchen-Sink is to
propose writing articles, tune their CSS, provide tags, add generators and so
on directly in the same source file.</p>
<h3 id="the-section-based-format">the section-based format</h3>
<p>The so-called section-based format has a <a href="/sections.html">dedicated article</a> to
document specific mechanism.  In this article we merely show-off <a href="/gen/out/features.cmark__cat-features-cmark">the source
for this article</a> to get an
impression of what writing <em>meaty content</em> entails.</p>
<h3 id="tunable-css-per-page">tunable CSS per page</h3>
<p>Among sections worth a “feature” label, a special section drives the
inlined-CSS of individual articles. In short, each article can have its own CSS
file.  I found that especially useful when I need to add some rules only for a
given article (e.g., alternating figure alignments) or when I want to host a
single-page JavaScript-app on an article only.  Thus, you should use <code>@import</code>
directives for CSS modularization and re-use across pages.  You do not lose
much in expressivity, a bit in performance, but you gain a lot in flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="commonmark-as-main-input-articles">CommonMark as main input articles</h3>
<p>Writing articles is mostly done in <a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>. That
is, the <em>meaty content</em> and some advanced analyses are based on CommonMark.</p>
<p>Besides the basics for headings, links, raw-HTML, <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>boldness</strong>, and <code>code</code>.
A number of extensions and additional extensions are enabled.</p>
<h4 id="emojis-eyes">emojis <span class="emoji" data-emoji="eyes">👀</span></h4>
<p>Adding emojis is a way to incorporate some emotions in written-web content.
The list of <code>:emoji-codes:</code> is available <a href="https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908"><span class="emoji" data-emoji="arrow_right">➡️</span> here <span class="emoji" data-emoji="arrow_left">⬅️</span></a> <span class="emoji" data-emoji="fire">🔥</span>.</p>
<h4 id="delimited-blocks-divs-with-attributes">delimited blocks divs with attributes</h4>
<p>Which allow to add some CSS classes, and HTML identifiers</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<pre><code>::: {.todo #smalldiv}
  add something
:::
</code></pre>
<p>generates the following code</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode"><span id="1"><a href="#1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">&lt;div</span> <span class="er">id</span><span class="ot">=</span><span class="st">&quot;smalldiv&quot;</span> <span class="er">class</span><span class="ot">=</span><span class="st">&quot;todo&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></span>
<span id="2"><a href="#2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">&lt;p&gt;</span>add something<span class="kw">&lt;/p&gt;</span></span>
<span id="3"><a href="#3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which can then be styled in CSS.</p>
<h4 id="syntax-highlighting-with-skylighting">syntax highlighting with <code>skylighting</code></h4>
<p>Code-blocks are analyzed by <a href="https://github.com/jgm/skylighting">skylighting</a>,
which tokenize code and wraps resulting code with HTML tags having some
well-defined classes for styling in CSS.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode"><span id="1"><a href="#1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">int</span> main<span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">int</span> argc<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">char</span><span class="op">**</span> argv<span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="2"><a href="#2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="3"><a href="#3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Overall I found that skylighting does the job and since the library requires no
extra JavaScript on the resulting website or external-dependencies at
code-generation time: it’s good.</p>
<h3 id="copies-other-images-css">copies other images, css</h3>
<p>An article often comes with extra medias. Images (with <code>jpeg</code>, <code>png</code>
extensions), JavaScript (<code>.js</code>) and CSS (<code>.css</code>) files are copied to
their own target at known location.  That is, KitchenSink wants everything in a
directory but applies rule so that you get something a bit cleaner in return,
isn’t it awesome?</p>
<p>You can see for yourself, compare the <a href="/gen/out/features.cmark__tree-site-input-cmark.json">listing of this website source directory</a> with the <a href="/gen/out/features.cmark__tree-site-output-cmark.json">listing of the website output directory</a> (courtesy of <code>tree -J</code>).</p>
<h3 id="generate-images-from-dot">generate images from <code>.dot</code></h3>
<p>There is a special room in my heart for <a href="https://graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a> <span class="emoji" data-emoji="heart">❤️</span>. I use it a lot to render diagrams and illustrate simple ideas. Thus I found natural to add some special support for files with the <code>.dot</code> extensions.</p>
<p><img src="/gen/images/features-002-dot-demo.dot.png" alt="all in the kitchen-sink" /></p>
<p>Coupled with <a href="#auto-reload">auto-reload</a>, GraphViz-made diagrams work well
enough to edit technical articles without ever leaving my editor as illustrated in the following video:</p>

</section><section class="main-section"><h2 id="content-generation">content-generation</h2>
<p>The core-business of a static-site generator is to generate HTML output from
various input.  Thus, we could pedentically say that all content is
“generated”. Here we discuss cases where Kitchen-Sink goes the extra-mile to
provide extra features.</p>
<h3 id="embedded-data">embedded data</h3>
<p>Kitchen-Sink generate a host of data while assembling targets from input files.
Intermediary-representations. In particular, there is a <code>json</code> file generated
with each HTML article and is linked in the HTML <code>meta</code> tag with name
<code>ks:article_json</code>. So that individual scripts can then locate these
information. As we get more mileage, we’ll likely add more of such paths and
formalize a bit their expected content.  However, keep in mind that
Kitchen-Sink generates more than just the static aspects of the HTML: it
provides a bunch of extra information which can be useful for <a href="#content-analysis">creative and advanced analyses</a>.</p>
<h3 id="command-based-generators">command-based generators</h3>
<p>In this article I’ve already pointed to a number of links (e.g., the source of
this article, some directory listings).  In short, you can add one-off data
collections that produce their own targets.</p>
<p>A typical usage is to turn some information about the system generating the
blog (e.g. <code>uname -a</code>). However you could get creative such as</p>
<ul>
<li>fetch the latest news-article
</li>
<li>run some database query to be displayed in javascript later
</li>
<li>taking a <a href="/gen/out/features.cmark__latest-selfie.jpg">selfie</a> on demand (yes, this picture happens to be my face when I generate this website – hat tip to <code>fswebcam</code>)
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="microscriptable-in-dhall">microscriptable in Dhall</h3>
<p>I have written a <a href="https://lucasdicioccio.github.io/dhall-section-demo.html">full article</a> on my personal blog a while ago to motivate the whole usage of <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>. Keep in mind that I’m still happy about the choice. Dhall “powers” my photo galleries and my <a href="https://lucasdicioccio.github.io/notes.html">stream of notes</a> on my personal blog.</p>
</section><section class="main-section"><h2 id="article-organization">article organization</h2>
<p>An article needs some <em>decorum</em> to help readers of your site as well as other
applications relaying your articles. For instance, who is the author? what
topics are covered? can you summarize it for me? Kitchen-Sink has a number of
features to answer such questions. Most if not all of these features are
controlled by specific <a href="/sections.html">sections</a> in the section-based-format.
Here we merely give an overview of what is feasible.</p>
<h3 id="categories-using-tags">categories using tags</h3>
<p>Article can be labelled with a set of tags. Kitchen-Sink then collects all
articles for a given tag under special categories and under the <code>/topics</code>
route. This is not especially innovative but I believe it’s a must have even if
I suppose most readers do not really use these topics listing a lot, they are
used to connect articles in the [site map](#sitemap graph).</p>
<h3 id="article-summaries">article summaries</h3>
<p>Article have summaries. The use case for summaries is to entice readers into
committing more time to read an article in full.</p>
<p>Technically, summaries are inserted in article listings. The main listing is
the home-page of a blog.  <a href="#categories-using-tags">Categories listings</a> also
repeat the listings. The summary also is used in some <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> headers, in
particular to provide neat summaries when people share your articles (cf. <a href="#open-graph-and-twitter-card-metas">open-graph</a>).</p>
<h3 id="social-links">social links</h3>
<p>In this age of pervasive Internet, you may have accounts in a number of online
social-networks. Kitchen-Sink supports some of these: list your handles and
enable features (as of today: it’s only a link to your canonical profile, in
the future we could imagine more interactions).</p>
<h3 id="open-graph-and-twitter-card-metas">open-graph and twitter-card metas</h3>
<p>You’ve probably already seen how some chat-applications (e.g., Discord, Slack)
and social-services (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter) provide a preview of webpages
that are linked. These previews can embed images. You need to follow some
specifications to control these, and that is what Kitchen-Sink does.  Indeed
Kitchen-Sink generates <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> HTML headers for <a href="https://ogp.me/">OpenGraph</a>
and <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards">Twitter
cards</a>.</p>
</section><section class="main-section"><h2 id="content-analysis">content-analysis</h2>
<p>Whether you write individual articles or a long series of multiple articles, it
is useful to have some way to summarize what you have written. For instance,
you want to know whether an article is connected to other articles, you want to
understand if sections are well-balanced or not.</p>
<p>All of these reasons were decisive factors when deciding to write and while <a href="/design-points.html">designing</a> Kitchen-Sink. I’ve merely scratched the surface of the analyses I want to make on my own writing and I hope you’ll find some of these helpful too.</p>
<h3 id="site-listing-and-search-box">site listing and search-box</h3>
<p>Static sites lack a good user-driven search as there are no servers to answer
search queries. Topics listing alleviate some of these need. Topics merely are
pre-computed indexes. Thus, KitchenSink also want to pre-compute search
indexes. At the moment, the search-box is primitive and only allows to search
into filenames (and I use it all the time when authoring articles to find
<a href="/json/paths.json">links to images and generated outputs</a>).  However we could
definitely go a step further by also searching, or displaying summaries in the
search box. As people say: watch this space!</p>
<h3 id="wordcounts-and-article-staircases">wordcounts and article staircases</h3>
<p>One key aspect of writing content for the web is to control the length of an
article. While writing for a printed format (my experience is with academic
publishing) the number of pages and the number of column-per-page for articles
is a good indication of the size of the content.  Infinitely-long pages on the
web blur this signal. Thus, to rebuild some understanding of how-long an
article is, we need to run word counts.</p>
<p>As a result, Kitchen-Sink compute a word count for each article (in addition to
images, links counts). Even further, Kitchen-Sink computes a word-count per
title-section. Which allows us to display what I call article staircases with visualization libraries (here we use <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html">Apache ECharts</a>):</p>
<div id="histogram">
</div>
<script src="/js/echarts.min.js"></script>
<script src="/js/echart-histogram.js"></script>
<p>The above histogram shows, for each section in the article, the number of words
and the cumulated number of words in the article. This histogram allows me,
when writing an article, to spot which sections are abnormally-long or
abnormally short. I interpret this graph to find opportunities to split or
merge sections together, hopefully improving my writing for users.</p>
<p>Kitchen-Sink also computes <a href="/json/filecounts.json">whole-site summaries</a>
although I have no great use-case yet for these.</p>
<h3 id="sitemap-graph">sitemap graph</h3>
<p>Kitchen-Sink processes all of the above information (topics, links between
pages, image lists, etc.) to populate a <a href="/json/topicsgraph.json">JSON representation of a
graph</a> summarizing the structure of the whole site.
This special target is built with the website and you can be creative with it.
So far, Kitchen-Sink provides a minimal <a href="/js/site-graph.js">JavaScript</a> to turn
the graph into an interactive-picture using <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html">Apache
Echarts</a>.</p>
