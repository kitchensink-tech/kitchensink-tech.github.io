Kitchen-Sink is a [_frivolous_](/philosophy.html )  static-site generator.

This website is the main documentation and main example of Kitchen-Sink features. You can install KitchenSink from source [using the GitHub directory](https://github.com/kitchensink-tech/kitchensink ).

We don't claim to be the best organized nor the fastest nor the prettiest. We just want to generate web pages from content and move on.
