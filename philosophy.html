apologetic or unapologetic statements regarding the lack of sophistication of
Kitchen-Sink. I lament when something is suboptimal but ought to be improved. I
duck out when something is suboptimal but ought to be left out scope. Let me
explain the three Kitchen-Sink tenets.</p>
<h1 id="the-kitchen-sink-tenets">The Kitchen-Sink tenets</h1>
<p>The name of the blog-engine is not just a pun. There’s some philosophy behind
the name, a philosophy that I grew out of experience: a mix of frivolity,
defeatism, and awe – applied to small static sites and blogs.</p>
<p><strong>Frivolity</strong>. When you are too lazy to wash and sort plates, you drop them in
the kitchen sink. You’ll come back later. In short, <em>take it easy</em>.  really
need to rest a bit and take it easy on yourselves. The world is tough enough to
add extra-high expectation onto oneself. Blogging should be the similarly
lightweight. Unless you want to make a career out of blogging, you should be
frivolous about your online site.</p>
<p><strong>Defeatism</strong>. Humans often fall in for the same traps. Rather than doing
something, we find roundabout ways for not doing them. A sure-fire way for
engineers to lose time is while trying to organize things in large hierarchies
and inter-connected ontologies … when there is alomost no content to
organize. Blogging is the primary use-case for Kitchen-sink. In this context, I
feel afraid that people spend time organizing and preparing a blog but then
write no articles. Rather, I think the key value of blogs is in having content
from people voicing their unique opinions.  If it’s only in text files with no
colors, then so be it.</p>
<p><strong>Awe</strong>. I have a huge amount of respect for scrapy and low-tech solutions
providing outsized results. Such solutions typically <em>do not scale</em> and require
engineering to step up in intrisinc (or perceived) quality.  When asked to grow
a low-tech solution into some more professional service, engineers tend to
codify processes and invent complex hierarchies before having any content to
arrange (cf. the above point on defeatism). When approaching the world with a
frivolous mindset, a tool that only works for the easy-mode will feel awesome
because these easy problems will be the ones you’ll encounter most of the time.
Regarding blogging this tenet means that the world improves when articles are
written, even if these articles lack perfection.</p>
